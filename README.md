UDACITY - FRONT-END NANODEGREE - PROJECT 6 - FEED READER TESTING
=================================================================
This project entailed writing multiple tests using jasmine.js to
ascertain the functionality of various aspects of the feed reader
webpage.


TESTS OVERVIEW
=================================================================
1)	The first tests determine whether the feeds are defined and
	if they have URLs and names.
2)	The next set of tests examine whether the menu changes
	visiblity when clicked.
3)	The last tests ensure that the container has at least one
	feed and also confirms that new feeds are loaded.


INSTRUCTIONS
=================================================================
RSS FEEDS:
	Comment out the 'allFeeds' array in app.js. This will cause
	the test to fail and will say "RSS Feeds are not defined".
	

SEARCH FUNCTION:
	Enter a word or some text in the search box. The search 
	function will filter the list based on the text you entered.
THE LIST: 
	Click any venue in the list. Information from Foursquare will
	pop up.
MAP & MARKERS:
	Click any of the markers and a Foursquare infowindow will 
	pop up. Click the X in the upper-right corner of the 
	infowindow to close the window.
